### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):
- RAG is a relatively new artificial intelligence technique that can improve the quality of generative AI by allowing large language model (LLMs) to tap additional data resources without retraining.

### Introduction

- This repository contains the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, Streamlit, FAISS Vector Database, and HuggingFace Embedding.This combination of technologies allows us to tackle complex information retrieval and natural language understanding tasks.

### Key Components

- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introducti) : LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
- [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/build-conversational-apps): An innovative open-source framework for building and sharing machine learning web applications.
- [FAISS Vector Database](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss): A high-performance library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR).
- [HuggingFace Embedding](https://huggingface.co/blog/getting-started-with-embeddings): Cutting-edge natural language processing models from HuggingFace, utilized for generating embeddings.
- [Open-source Llama 2 Model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF): I leverage the open-source Llama 2 model to enhance the performance and accuracy of our pipeline.
